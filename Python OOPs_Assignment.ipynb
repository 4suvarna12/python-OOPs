You interact with buttons like \"Power,\" \"Volume Up,\" and \"Channel Down.\"\n","- You don't need to know the intricate electronic circuitry inside that makes these actions happen. The remote abstracts away the complex internal workings.\n","\n","\n","-Encapsulation:\n","- Wrapping data and funtions into a single class.\n","- Encapsulation is about bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (a class)\n","\n","- How it's achieved:\n","- Classes: Grouping data and methods within a class.\n","- Access Modifiers (or naming conventions in Python): Defining the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). For example, making attributes private restricts direct access from outside the class, and access is controlled through public methods (getters and setters).\n","\n","- Analogy: Consider a capsule containing medicine.\n","\n","- The medicine (data) is enclosed within the capsule (the class). You can only access the medicine by taking the capsule as a whole. The capsule encapsulates the medicine and protects it from external factors\n","\n","- Abstraction and encapsulation often work together to achieve a well-structured and robust object-oriented design.\n","- Abstraction helps in defining the blueprint and interface, while encapsulation helps in implementing and protecting the internal workings of those blueprints.\n","\n","5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n","- In Python, \"dunder methods\" (often called \"magic methods\") are special methods that have double underscores (dunderscores) before and after their names. They are used to define how instances of a class should behave in certain built-in operations and contexts.\n","\n","- Think of them as hooks that allow you to customize the behavior of your objects when you use Python's operators, built-in functions, and language constructs.\n","\n","6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","- when one class(derived/child) derives the properties & method of another class(Parents/base) is called inheritance\n","- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class 1  (called the derived class, 2  subclass, or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called the base class, superclass, or parent class)\n","- Types of Inheritance (depending on the programming language):\n","\n","- Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from only one base class (common in languages like Java and Python).\n","\n","- Multiple Inheritance: A derived class can inherit from multiple base classes (supported by languages like Python, C++). This can sometimes lead to complexities like the \"diamond problem\" where a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity about which inherited method to use.\n","\n","- Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class inherits from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance (e.g., Grandparent -> Parent -> Child).\n","\n","- Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class (e.g., Animal -> Dog, Animal -> Cat, Animal -> Bird).\n","\n","- Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of different types of inheritance.\n","\n","7.what is polymorphism in OOP?\n","- Polymorphism derived from greek word,Poly means many and morph means form this a fundamental concept in oop\n","\n","- one interface can have multiple form based on differnt data type\n","- ex.\n","\n","- def func( a, b)\n","-- return a+b\n","\n","- func(1,2) #for integer meaning of same funtion is diffrent i.e addition\n","- func(\"suvarna\",\"Prasad\")# for string meaning of same funtion is different i.e concatination of string\n","- func([1,2,3] + [4,5,6]) # mering of two list\n","\n","8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","- Encapsulation in Python is achieved through a combination of naming conventions and access modifiers\n","- Wrapping data and funtions into a single class.\n","- Here's how encapsulation is typically implemented in Python:\n","\n","1. Naming Conventions (The Primary Mechanism):\n","\n","- Public Members: Attributes and methods that are intended to be accessed from outside the class are usually named with a standard, non-prefixed identifier (e.g., name, age, calculate_area()). This signals that these members are part of the object's public interface.\n","\n","- \"Protected\" Members (Single Leading Underscore): Attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore (_) are conventionally treated as \"protected.\" This suggests that they are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses. While Python doesn't strictly prevent external access to these members, it's a strong convention that programmers should respect. Modifying these directly from outside is generally discouraged as it can break the class's internal logic.\n","\n","- \"Private\" Members (Double Leading Underscore - Name Mangling): Attributes and methods prefixed with a double underscore (__) have a special behavior called name mangling. Python renames these members internally to make it harder (but not impossible) to access them directly from outside the class. The name is changed to _ClassName__membername. This provides a stronger form of \"privacy\" compared to the single underscore convention\n","\n","\n","9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","- a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object (an instance) of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes (data members) and perform any other setup that is needed when a new instance is created.\n","\n","10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","- Use class methods when you need to access or modify class-level attributes or when you want to create factory methods that return instances of the class (or its subclasses).\n","\n","- Use static methods when the method is logically related to the class but doesn't need to interact with the class itself or its instances. They are essentially regular functions that are organized within the class's namespace for better code structure.\n","\n","11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","- same method is taking multiple form based on number of arguments are called method overloading\n","- class Calculator:\n","-- def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n","        return a + b + c\n","\n","- calc = Calculator()\n","- print(calc.add(5))      # a=5, b=0, c=0 -> Output: 5\n","- print(calc.add(5, 3))   # a=5, b=3, c=0 -> Output: 8\n","- print(calc.add(5, 3, 2))# a=5, b=3, c=2 -> Output: 10\n","\n","12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n","- method in parent class and child class with same signature(method),the child class method will execute\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vwvxurpqeZcO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Vehicle:\n","    def start(self):\n","        print(\"Vehicle started.\")\n","\n","class Car(Vehicle):\n","    def start(self):\n","        super().start()# Call the start() method of the superclass\n","        print(\"Car engine is running.\")\n","\n","my_car = Car()\n","my_car.start()\n","# Output:\n","# Vehicle started.\n","# Car engine is running."],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"O_ZpdTWHWADk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744467259294,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Suvarna Patil","userId":"13477488174897047842"}},"outputId":"a44dccad-e456-4c60-bc63-08348639cc7c"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vehicle started.\n","Car engine is running.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#constructor Example 1 (therotical question 9)\n","class ABC:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        print(\"Hi you called me?\")\n","\n","    def greet(self):\n","        print(\"Good Evening\")\n","\n","o = ABC()\n","# Constructor Example 2\n","class student:\n","    name = \"\"\n","    phy_marks = 0\n","    chem_marks = 0\n","    maths_marks = 0\n","\n","    def calculate_totalmarks(self):\n","        t = self.phy_marks + self.chem_marks + self.maths_marks\n","        return t\n","\n","    def calculate_percentage(self):\n","        p = (self.phy_marks + self.chem_marks + self.maths_marks)/3\n","        return p\n","\n","# Create an object of student\n","s1 = student()\n","s1.name = \"Darshan\"\n","s1.phy_marks = 90\n","s1.chem_marks = 80\n","s1.maths_marks = 70\n","print(f\"Total marks: {s1.calculate_totalmarks()}\")\n","print(f\"Percentage: {s1.calculate_percentage()}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XmzNGWuA35dO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744375524303,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Suvarna Patil","userId":"13477488174897047842"}},"outputId":"7e86dd8f-e420-4e46-958d-b773cebe6984"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hi you called me?\n","Total marks: 240\n","Percentage: 80.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","- A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator (@property) that provides a concise and Pythonic way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes. It allows you to define methods that look and behave like regular instance attributes, but with the added ability to execute custom code when these attributes are accessed, modified, or deleted.\n","\n","14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","- Polymorphism is extremely important in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for several key reasons, contributing significantly to code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.\n","\n","15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","- class which have abstract method is called abstract class.\n","- here abstract method means the method which have declaration but not defination we call abstract method\n","- we can't create object of abstract class\n","- abstract class is subclass of ABC\n","- ABC means abstract base classes and it's imported from abc module\n","-- from abc import ABC,abstractmethod\n","\n","16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","1. Code Reusability (Inheritance):\n","\n","- Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived class or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or superclass).\n","- This promotes code reuse, as you can define common functionalities in a base class and have multiple derived classes inherit and utilize them.\n","- It reduces code duplication, saves development time, and makes the codebase more maintainable. If you need to change a common behavior, you only need to modify it in the base class, and all derived classes will inherit the change.\n","2. Flexibility (Polymorphism):\n","\n","- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.\n","- This enables you to write more generic and flexible code that can work with objects of various types without needing to know their exact class.\n","- It makes it easier to extend the system with new types of objects that can seamlessly integrate with existing code that uses the common interface.\n","3. Encapsulation:\n","\n","- Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single1 unit (a class).\n","- It also involves controlling access to the internal data of an object, preventing direct and unauthorized modification from outside the object.\n","- This protects the integrity of the data and makes the code more robust. - You can control how the object's state is changed through well-defined methods (getters and setters or properties).\n","4. Abstraction:\n","\n","- Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential information to the user.\n","- OOP achieves abstraction through classes and objects, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n","- This simplifies the user's interaction with objects and makes the code easier to understand and work with at a higher level.\n","\n","17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instancevariable?\n","- Class Variable:\n","\n","- Definition: A class variable is defined within the class but outside of any instance methods (like __init__, or other regular methods).\n","- Scope: Class variables belong to the class itself. They are shared among all instances (objects) of that class.\n","- Access:They can be accessed directly using the class name (e.g., ClassName.class_variable).\n","\n","- instance variable:\n","- Definition: An instance variable is defined inside instance methods, usually within the __init__ method using the self keyword (e.g., self.instance_variable = value).\n","- Scope: Instance variables belong to the specific instance (object) of the class. Each instance has its own independent copy of the instance variables.\n","- Access: Instance variables are accessed using the instance object followed by the dot notation (e.g., instance.instance_variable). You cannot directly access them using the class name alone.\n","\n","18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","- when one derived class is inherit the property of multiple parent class\n","- class C(A,B)\n","\n","19.Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python?\n","- __str__(self): For Human Consumption (Informal Representation)\n","\n","- Purpose: The primary goal of __str__ is to provide a human-readable, informal, and nicely formatted string representation of an object.\n","- It should be easily understandable by end-users or anyone who might interact with the output of your program.\n","- Focus: It focuses on being informative and readable.\n","- It doesn't necessarily need to contain all the details required to recreate the object.\n","\n","- __repr__(self): For Developers and Debugging (Formal Representation)\n","\n","- Purpose: The main goal of __repr__ is to provide an unambiguous, formal, and detailed string representation of an object.\n","- It should ideally contain all the information necessary to recreate the object.\n","- This is particularly useful for debugging, logging, and development.\n","- Focus: It focuses on being unambiguous and informative for developers. - - If possible, the string returned should be a valid Python expression that, when evaluated, would create an object with the same value.\n","\n","20.What is the significance of the \"super()\" function in Python?\n","- Enables calling parent class methods without explicitly naming the parent class, leading to more flexible and maintainable code.\n","\n","- Ensures proper initialization of inherited attributes in subclass constructors.\n","- Facilitates cooperative behavior in multiple inheritance scenarios by following the Method Resolution Order.\n","- Promotes better code organization and reduces coupling between classes in an inheritance hierarchy.\n","\n","21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","- The __del__ method in Python is a special \"dunder\" (double underscore) method that is called when an object is about to be garbage collected because there are no more references to it.\n","- It's often referred to as the \"destructor\" method\n","\n","22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","- @staticmethod:\n","\n","- First Argument: A static method does not receive any implicit first argument.\n","- It behaves like a regular function that is defined within the class's namespace.\n","- Access to Class and Instance: A static method cannot directly access the class itself (cls) or any specific instance (self) of the class.\n","\n","- @classmethod:\n","- First Argument: A class method receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.\n","- Access to Class: A class method has access to the class through the cls parameter.\n","- This means it can access and modify class attributes and call other class methods.\n","- Access to Instance: A class method does not have direct access to a specific instance's attributes (the self of an instance method). However, it can create new instances of the class if needed.\n","\n","23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","- Polymorphism in Python, when combined with inheritance, allows you to treat objects of different classes (that are related through a common base class) in a uniform way.\n","- The key idea is that a single interface (often a method defined in the base class) can have multiple implementations in the derived classes, and the correct implementation is executed based on the actual type of the object at runtime\n","\n","24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","- Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple method calls are made on the same object in a single statement, one after the other. This is achieved by having each method in the sequence return the object itself\n","\n","25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","- The __call__ method is a special method in Python that allows instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. In other words, if a class defines the __call__ method, you can call an instance of that class using parentheses, just like you would call a regular function.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qt96cv_QXBn4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"8Jk0iPX2k0-q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["17.Create a class Book with attributes title, author, and year_published.
